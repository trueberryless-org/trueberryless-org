# Astro Component Starter

A starter template with 40+ Astro components, each built for visual editing in [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/). You clone it, you own it. Every component is your source code to modify, extend, or delete.

All the source code and content is yours, it lives in your repository and you decide when (or if) to pull in future improvements from the core repo.

The design is intentionally unbranded so it can morph into any brand you want. Update CSS variables and the entire site shifts to match your colors, fonts, and identity. Components are built on web fundamentals: vanilla CSS, semantic HTML, and a sprinkling of vanilla JS only when something can't be done with CSS alone. Performance and accessibility are baked in from the start.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-astro-component-starter my-site-name
cd my-site-name
npm run dev
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:4321`.

This command scaffolds the latest starter into a local project folder, sets the starter repo as `upstream`, and installs dependencies automatically.

**Make your first change:** Open `src/content/pages/index.md`, change the hero heading, and watch it update in your browser.

## What You'll See

- **Your site** at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321), a fully working demo with pages, blog, and navigation
- **Component docs** at [localhost:4321/component-docs/](http://localhost:4321/component-docs/), documentation, examples, and a visual builder for every component

## The Three-File Pattern

Every component in this starter ships with three files. This is what makes the system work: developers build components, editors visually manage content.

```
src/components/.../button/
├── Button.astro                          # The component
├── button.cloudcannon.inputs.yml         # What editors see and can change
└── button.cloudcannon.structure-value.yml # Defaults and picker metadata
```

## Key Directories

```
src/
├── components/          # All 40+ components (yours to edit)
│   ├── building-blocks/ # Core UI: buttons, headings, forms, layout wrappers
│   ├── page-sections/   # Full-width sections: heroes, features, CTAs
│   └── navigation/      # Header, footer, mobile nav
├── content/             # Your pages and blog posts (Markdown/MDX)
├── styles/              # Design tokens, themes, base styles
│   ├── variables/       # Colors, fonts, spacing, widths
│   └── themes/          # Light and dark theme definitions
└── component-docs/   # Built-in docs (can be excluded from production builds)
```
